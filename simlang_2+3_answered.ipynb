We're using Python because its code is concise and clear, and the meaning of the code is transparent.

The notebook is made up of \"cells\" which you can move between with the mouse or arrow keys. The cells come in different types. We'll be using \"markdown\" cells, which let you type in formatted text, and \"code\" cells, which let you type in and run Python instructions."

The former is called *command mode* - when in command mode, if you click on a cell once you'll see that the cell gets a blue outline (on the left). When you're in command mode you cannot edit the text inside the cell, but you can do things like move up or down through the cells using the up and down arrow keys, delete a cell or add a new cell below or above. You get into \"edit mode\" when you double click on a cell, or when you select it and then press enter, in which case the cell gets a green outline. Now you're 'inside' the cell, which allows you to edit the text or Python code inside. Press SHIFT + ENTER to 'execute' (i.e. run) the cell and switch back to command mode. Alternatively, you can jump back out into command mode without executing the cell by pressing the ESC key.\n",

You'll find using keyboard shortcuts is very handy when you're working inside a notebook. Find out more about the keyboard shortcuts by going to Help --> Keyboard Shortcuts, or by pressing H when in command mode (ESC + H if you are in edit mode). \n"

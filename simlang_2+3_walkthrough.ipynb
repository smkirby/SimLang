    "Every function definition starts something like this. We use `def` to tell Python we are about to provide it with a definition of a function. We then give the function name: in this case I chose product, since that seems like a sensible name for a function that is going to return the product of two numbers, but I could have called it anything. Then, between brackets (...), I give the arguments that this function will take: in this case, we are going to pass two numbers to the function (which it will then multiply), so it has two arguments. Here, I decided to call them `x` and `y`, but again I could have called them anything I wanted: `n1` `n2`,`jack` and `jill`, whatever. Finally, we have a colon :. The body of the function - the stuff that actually happens when we use this function - follows this colon.\n",

Notice that, if you type this into the notebook, it automatically indents for you after the colon at the end of the previous line: the body of the function is a block of code, and blocks of code are indicated by indentation.\n",
    "\n",
    "We use return to indicate that we want this function to return some value - we are going to pass two values in to this function, we want it to pass us a single value back (namely, the product of the two numbers we passed in), and return is how we do this. Then we have an expression which tells it what to return: in this case, `x * y`, i.e. the product of the two numbers we passed in to the function as arguments. So when we actually use this function it will multiply whatever two numbers we give it, and return (pass back) the product of those numbers."

Just like in `first_in_list`, we are returning some item from `alist`, so we have `alist[...]`. The interesting stuff with this function happens inside the square brackets. We want the last item from `alist`, and to get it we are using the `len` function.\n",
    "\n",
    "`len` is one of the built-in functions that is automatically defined when you start Python. If this was a programming course, we’d ask you to define your own `len` function, for fun, but basic functions like this are almost always provided for you, so we won’t bother with that. `len(alist)` will return the length of alist: so if `alist` has 1 element, `len(alist)` will return 1, if it has 4 elements, `len(alist)` will return 4, and so on.\n",
    "\n",
    "We subtract 1 from the number provided by `len(alist)`: that’s what `len(alist) - 1` means. This is the position in the list we want: if `alist` only has one thing in it, it has length 1 and the last element is the 0th element in that list (which is `len(alist) - 1`); if `alist` has 4 things in it, it has length 4 and the last element in that list has index 3 (which is `len(alist) - 1`). If this seems a bit confusing, remember that the “first” item in a list has index 0.\n",

In this case, all we are doing with `x` is printing `x` out times itself: this is what `print(x * x)` achieves. Note also that we're not using `return` anywhere. That's because what the function is doing is printing stuff on the screen, rather than giving us an answer back."

    "**A function which returns the largest number in a list.**\n",
    "\n",
    "This function is actually quite complex. Before I go through the code, I’ll explain the basic procedure that my code uses. Often, if you want to write a function that does something interesting, you should start by working out a step-by-step procedure for how this thing is to be achieved - once you know what you are doing, the code should be easy(ish!) to write, but if you try to write the code without really knowing what you are trying to do you’ll just end up in a mess.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this case, my general idea is that I am going to work through the list of numbers, left to right, and keep a note of the highest value I have encountered so far. I’ll call this something like “current max”. So as I go through the list I know what current max is. For each new element in the list, I compare it to current max. If it’s greater than current max, then it becomes my new current max: I forget what the old current max was, and replace it with this new value I have just encountered. On the other hand, if this new number is not greater than current max, I don’t have to do anything: I just forget about this new value, and just move on down the list, keeping current max as it was.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, when I have worked through this entire list, I have to remember to return my current max: this is what the function is supposed to do, and by the time I have gone through the list I will definitely have encountered and remembered the highest value in that list, which I am calling current max, so I just return that.\n",
    "\n",
    "I think that’ll work. The only other thing I have to decide is what value of current max I should start with. I guess I could choose some extremely low value that’s probably going to be lower than anything in the list, but that’s a bit risky (what if I guess wrong?), so instead the sensible thing to do is take the very first item from the list as my initial highest value, then work down the rest of the list, checking to see if I can find anything higher.\n",
    "\n",
    "OK, now I have a plan I can work through the code, explaining how it executes the procedure I have just outlined.\n",

    "```python\n",
    "def max_in_list(alist):\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "I introduce a new variable, which I call `current_max`. This is where I am storing the current maximum value that I have encountered. Initially I assign this variable the value `alist[0]`, i.e. the 0th element in the list I am working with.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "    for x in alist[1:]:\n",
    "```\n",

    "Now we have a for loop, which is going to help me work through the list. Compare this line with the equivalent line in my `square_list` function: it basically looks the same, but instead of working through all of `alist`, I am going to work through `alist[1:]`. `alist[1:]` is the list of elements in alist from index 1 to the end - in other words everything in alist apart from element 0. Check back over the notes in the worksheet where this “splice” notation is explained to refresh your memory. It wouldn't actually matter if I just worked through all of alist (i.e. replaced this line of code with `for x in alist:`), but since I’ve already looked at element 0 in the list it seems a bit of a waste to look at it again.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, to recap, we’re going to take every element from the rest of the list in turn, call it `x`, and do something with it.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "        if x > current_max:\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The notebook has indented us a bit more: we are now inside the code block that is executed for every `x` in `alist[1:]`. And what we have is a conditional statement: so we compare the element `x` to `current_max`, and if `x` is greater than `current_max` we do whatever it says in the next code block.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "            current_max = x\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "And what we do, if our condition is met, is overwrite `current_max` with `x`: so if the value we are currently considering (which we are calling `x`) is greater than the highest value we have encountered so far (which we are calling `current_max`), then we store `x` as our new `current_max` (and forget whatever the old value of `current_max` was). Notice we're indented again one more time because this is the code block for the result of the conditional statement.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "    return current_max\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The indenting at this point gets interesting: we have actually come out two levels, which means we are out of the body of the `if` conditional, and also out of the body of the `for` loop: so in other words, this line of code is executed once the for loop has completely finished. This line of code simply states that we return the value of `current_max` that we have ended up with after working through the list using the for loop. Remember, this was the plan: work through the list, keep a note of the maximum value encountered, and then when we have gone all the way through the list we return that value.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The geeky solution...**\n",
    "\n",
    "See if you can figure out why this other solution to the max in list problem also works:\n",

    "def geeky_max_in_list(alist):\n",
    "    if len(alist) > 1:\n",
    "        max_of_rest = geeky_max_in_list(alist[1:])\n",
    "        if alist[0] < max_of_rest:\n",
    "            return max_of_rest\n",
    "    return alist[0]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Don't worry too much if you can't figure it out. But think through it line by line. Notice that in this function, we're actually calling the function from within itself on the third line! This is called \"recursion\" and is actually very similar to the kind of recursion that linguists talk about. When you're writing a function, you can sort of pretend that the function is already finished and working and then use it when you're writing it. What's happening here, is that we're thinking of the problem of finding the maximum in a list as being the same as comparing the *first* number of a list with the maximum of the *rest* of the list. If the first number is bigger than the all the other numbers in the list, then the maximum is the first number, otherwise the maximum is the biggest number in the rest of the list... Of course, if the list has only one element in it (i.e., it's length is 1) then that element must be the maximum by default."
